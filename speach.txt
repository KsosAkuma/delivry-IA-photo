Now that the introductions have been made, and before the fights begin, we're going to talk a bit about 'the world of artificial intelligence and creativity

Firstly, I selected a photo from the internet, to be honest, it was the first one that caught my eye. After that, I described the image, and I see 


"A photo of a hill filled with trees, with a Chinese-style palace building overlooking the hill.
In the foreground, at the bottom of the photo, a stone fence borders the foot of the hill along with a Chinese temple-style cabin.
The photo is taken at dusk, with a cloudy sky, and the orange rays of the sun reflecting on some of the clouds."

Now, I'll give you a moment to imagine this photo as I described it. Okay, here's the photo. Did you imagine it in the same way?

And what about the AI?

Well, just like you, I asked the AI to imagine and generate an image based on the description that I gave you. Of course, it's an AI specialized in image generation.

Now, we can see what the AI has generated, and it's amazing. I couldn't tell which one is real or fake.

I'll now hand over to my colleague for the next part.
